Spirit Rock Revival
===================

Overview
--------

**Spirit Rock Revival** is a project aimed at recreating the iconic Spirit Rocks from the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) in a virtual environment. Inspired by the recent removal of the rocks due to political protests, this project allows anyone with a valid UTD email to virtually paint on the rocks. Anyone can view the rocks and the creative expressions on them.

Features
--------

-   **Virtual Spirit Rocks**: Move around in 3D space, just like you're really there.
-   **Restricted Painting**: Only users with a UTD Dallas email can paint on the rocks, preserving the original spirit of the physical rocks.
-   **Public Viewing**: Anyone can view the virtual rocks and the artwork created by UTD students and alumni.
-   **Interactive Painting**: Click on the rocks to paint them with the selected color.

How It Works
------------

1.  **User Authentication**: To ensure only UTD Dallas email holders can paint, the system verifies email addresses before allowing painting
2.  **Color Selection**: Users can choose from a diverse color pallette to paint on the rocks with.
3.  **Painting Interaction**: Clicking on the rocks within the virtual environment allows users to apply the selected color to the surface.
